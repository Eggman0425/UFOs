# UFO Sightings

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings on Danaâ€™s webpage. I did this by adding more filters such as city, state, country, and shape, that users can search for at the same time. These added elements will help users navigate the webpage more easily. 

## Results
When scrolling through the UFO webpage, one might want an easier way to find what they are looking for. This is where the filter search bar comes in handy. By entering the date, city, state, country, or shape on the left-hand side of the page, the user will be able to quickly find the specific data they need.

## Summary
In conclusion, one drawback of this new filter design is that it can limit potential data for the user by being too specific. Two possible recommendations for further development are to, one, eliminate the shape filter and, two, implement a comments filter that lets the user search through the comments. This way the user can look for specific key words in the comments rather than rely solely on the shape filter to search for descriptions for UFOs.
